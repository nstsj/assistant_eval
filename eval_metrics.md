### Response time:
The time it takes for a chatbot to respond to a user's message. This is an important metric to ensure that the chatbot is responding quickly to users.

### Conversation duration:
The length of time a conversation lasts between a user and a chatbot. This metric can help evaluate user engagement.

### Task success rate:
The percentage of tasks that a chatbot can successfully complete. This is an important metric to evaluate the overall performance of the chatbot.

### User satisfaction:
The overall satisfaction of users with the chatbot. This metric can be measured using surveys or user feedback.

###  Task completion rate:
The percentage of tasks a dialogue system can successfully complete. This metric is important for evaluating the performance of the system in accomplishing specific tasks.

### Dialogue efficiency:
The speed and accuracy of the dialogue system in accomplishing a task. This metric can help evaluate the system's overall performance.

### User satisfaction:
The overall satisfaction of users with the dialogue system. This metric can be measured using surveys or user feedback.

### Diversity:
The ability of a dialogue system to generate diverse responses to user queries.


# Assistant Evaluation:

### Accuracy:
This metric measures the ability of the AI assistant to understand and correctly respond to user queries. It is usually measured as the percentage of correctly answered queries out of all the queries asked.

### Response Time:
This metric measures how quickly the AI assistant can respond to user queries. The response time should be fast enough to ensure that users do not have to wait too long for a response.

### User Satisfaction:
This metric measures how satisfied users are with the AI assistant's responses. User satisfaction can be measured through surveys or by analyzing user feedback.

### Error Rate:
This metric measures the number of errors made by the AI assistant. Errors can include misunderstandings of user queries, incorrect responses, or failure to respond at all.

### Task Completion Rate:
This metric measures the percentage of tasks that the AI assistant is able to complete successfully. For example, if a user asks the AI assistant to set a reminder, the task completion rate measures the percentage of times the AI assistant is able to successfully set the reminder.

### Robustness:
This metric measures how well the AI assistant performs under different conditions, such as variations in user accents, noisy environments, or changes in context.

### Engagement: 
This metric measures how often users engage with the AI assistant and how long they stay engaged. This can be measured through metrics such as session duration and frequency of usage.
